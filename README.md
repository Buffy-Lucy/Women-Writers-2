#Relations of husbands and wives

Being a woman or a man in early modern England was difficult for women compared to men because they were seen as inferior to the males and had little freedom. In early modern England, women were restricted in what they were allowed to do for example, they were unable to perform in theatres and as a result, men portrayed a woman through crossdressing. Two famous female writers during this period were Lady Anne Clifford and Katherine Phillips. Both female writers portray the relations between husband and wife through a personal diary written by Clifford and a poem from Katherine to her husband. These female writers both have first-hand experiences of a relationship between husband and wife. Clifford’s diaries show the depiction of spouses through how her husband treated her when he ‘played at dice in the Court and won nine hundred twenty-shilling pieces and gave me but twenty’ (Clifford. “Countess of Dorset’s Diary, 1616, 1617 and 1619”). However, Phillips’ poem to her husband “o my dearest Antenor, on his Parting” depicts relations between husband and wife through her grief at losing her husband, someone she deeply loved. This essay will critically consider how relations between husbands and wives are depicted in Clifford’s diaries and Phillips’ poem.

In both Clifford’s dairies and Phillips’ poem they depict the relations between husbands and wives from different perspectives. For example, Clifford’s dairies show relation between husband and wives through her individual experiences. Her first entry “The Lady Anne Clifford’s Memoir, 1603” informs the reader about her experience as a young child going into marriage. For early modern England, arranged marriages between children were common and seen as a normality. Phillips’ poem to her husband, Antenor, is depicted as a happy relation and one that brings sadness but also freedom. Gowing says how ‘the household was the fundamental unit of early modern society: the heart of economic, social and gender order.’ (Gowing. “Gender Relations in Early Modern England). Both literary works show this but in completely separate ways. Phillips follows the guidelines but redefines them after the death of her husband through her newfound freedom. However, Clifford remains following the guidelines after the death of her husband but does attempt to redefine gender barriers by employing ‘myself in building and reparations at Skipton and Barden Tower.’ (Clifford, “The Lady of the North, Yearly Memoirs, 1650-1675).

Clifford’s second entry “Countess of Dorset’s Dairy, 1616, 1617, 1619” depicts the marriage of Clifford and her husband conforming to gender order. She explains how she ‘kept my chamber all day, my Lady Rich and my sister Sackville dining with me, but my Lord and all the company at Dorset House went to see the masque at the Court.’ (Clifford. “Countess of Dorset’s Diary, 1616, 1617, 1619”). On the other hand, Phillips depicts relations between husbands and wives as a time of grieving when the husband dies, showing the love she had for him and how his passing has affected her. From her personal experience, she remarks how she must grieve when they part but believes this is a ‘happy change the loss of mine, is with advantage paid in having thine.’ (Phillips. “o my dearest Antenor, on his Parting”). This suggests that although husbands are meant to protect their wife, once they have passed, the wives have some freedom and because they are no longer bound to their husband. In Laura Gowing’s book, “Gender Relations in Early Modern England” she uses the idea that ‘in a patriarchal society system, the concepts of house, household and family carried considerable ideological weight.’ (Gowing. “Gender Relations in Early Modern England”). In saying this, Gowing is suggesting that because men are the main provider for the family, they shoulder most of the burden whereas women are unable to work because of the patriarchal system. The role of a husband and a wife, have certain expectations that both must follow, for example, a man should follow the rule that ‘every government imagined itself as ruling a nation made up of households whose order mirrored that of the state, with a father implicitly bound to protect a wife, children and servants.’ (Gowing. “Gender Relations in Early Modern England”). This means that a man’s role is solely to provide a safe place for his family by having a job and earning money for the family. However, a woman’s role was to stay at home with the children, clean the house, and have no participation in government affairs because that was a male only role.

Katherine Phillips writes about her husband in her poem, “o my dearest Antenor, on his Parting” and Lady Anne Clifford write about her husband in her diaries “The Lady Anne Clifford’s Memoir, 1603,” “Countess of Dorset’s Diary, 1616, 1617, 1619,” and “The Lady of the North, Yearly Memoirs, 1650-1675.” Both writers portray their husbands through different but similar perspectives and depicts the relations between husband and wives in completely diverse ways. Phillips represents her husband as someone she was deeply in love with, and his parting has caused her grief. Clifford, however, represents her husband as someone who conforms to the gender roles and was possible not as in love with him like Katherine and her husband. For example, Phillips’ writing style in her poem flows with a continuous rhyme scheme of AABB, depicting the emotion she felt once she lost her husband. She calls him “the Guardian of my Heart” (Phillips. “o my dearest Antenor, on his Parting”) which suggests she deeply cared for him and further on she mentions how “we were born to love, brought to agree, by the impressions of Divine Decree” (Phillips. “o my dearest Antenor, on his Parting,” showing that she loves him and believes fate brought them together. Although Clifford has some love towards her husband, she does not express it explicitly like Phillips does. She represents her husband as a dominant male who sticks to the gendered roles and leaves her behind to look after the house whilst he goes out to work.

Feminism played a massive part in the role of women because they wanted to have equal rights for all women. In both Lady Anne Clifford’s dairies and Katherine Phillips’ “o my dearest Antenor, on his Parting,” there is the brief underlying theme of feminism that both writers use. Sue-Ellen Case in “Feminism and theatre” says a ‘If feminism ‘begins’ anywhere, it begins with feelings of exclusion: with the growing awareness that women’s social and cultural lives and activities have been overlooked marginalised and trivialised by male-dominated social systems and cultural values.’ (Case, Sue-Ellen. Feminism and theatre. Macmillan International Higher Education, 2008.) This is clearly shown in both Phillips’ and Clifford’s work because there is an underlying element of wanting more for women instead of being dominated by a masculine society. For example, in Lady Anne Clifford’s diaries, the first entry “The Lady Anne Clifford’s Memoir, 1603” and the third entry “The Lady of the North, Yearly Memoirs, 1650-1675” have an underlying theme of wanting freedom and having rights for women. The tone she uses in these two diary entries, are open and informative, allowing the reader to understand her thoughts and feelings of what it is like to be a women in early modern England. Katherine Phillips, however, has an underlying theme of feminism but it is not as explicitly shown because she seems more content with remembering her husband but does understand that she has some freedom now that he has passed. The tone she uses in her poem is a happy tone with elements of sadness at the loss of her husband which suggests that unlike Anne, she and her husband had a good relationship, and his parting has affected her.

According to Gowing, ‘The concept of patriarchy has been central to feminist criticism: it was also pivotal for early modern political theorists. For historians interested in the structures which validate and maintain gender relations, patriarchy is an invaluable analytic tool. It describes a structural system in which men dominate women through labour relations, political power, male violence, sexuality and culture’ (Gowing. “Gender Relations in Early Modern England”). This suggests that the patriarchal system is structured to where men are superior and women are inferior because in early modern England, men were seen as the ones who had the power and were able to do things whereas women were the opposite and had to stay home. In Lady Anne Clifford’s diaries, she clearly shows the patriarchal society that she lives in because her husband is the one who has control over everything whereas she does not and therefore have to stay home while he goes out. For example, in “Countess of Dorset’s Diary, 1616, 1617 and 1619” she talks about how she keeps to her chambers and never leaves the country as she stayed “all the time in the country.” (Clifford. “Countess of Dorset’s Diary, 1616, 1617, 1619”). However, in Katherine Phillips’ “o my dearest Antenor, on his Parting” the patriarchal society is not as clear as it is in Anne’s diaries, but she does understand that while her husband was alive, he had control but after his parting, she breaks away from the society views and has some freedom. For example, in “o my dearest Antenor, on his Parting” she talks about how she can never forget him and will keep him in her memories, “will absent meet, and understand thy mind and thou at thy return shalt find thy heart” (Phillips. “o my dearest Antenor, on his Parting”). but recognises her freedom.

Overall, both Katherine Phillips and Lady Anne Clifford depict the relations between husbands and wives in Lady Anne Clifford’s diaries “The Lady Anne Clifford’s Memoir, 1603,” “Countess of Dorset’s Diary, 1616, 1617, 1619,” and “The Lady of the North, Yearly Memoirs, 1650-1675” and in Katherine Phillips’ “o my dearest Antenor, on his Parting” because they portray the gendered roles that society conforms them to. In early modern England, society was hugely patriarchal and was overpowered by the male population because women did not have many rights in what they could and could not do. For Clifford, she portrays her husband as the dominate male who has control over everything that happens whereas she is unable to do much. However, Phillips portrays her husband in a slightly separate way to Anne because she grieves over her husband’s passing and shows obvious signs of how much she cared for him but also is happy because she has the freedom now. As expressed, gender roles for women and men are completely different because men dominate in society over women through the patriarchal system. Gowing suggests that ‘in a patriarchal society system, the concepts of house, household and family carried considerable ideological weight’ showing the idea that men are the ones who have to provide for the house and for their family whereas women have to stay home to clean and look after children. However, after the passing of their husbands, they still follow the guidelines, but Phillips redefines them to suit her and her newfound freedom whereas Clifford remains following the guidelines but employs herself in building and repairing suggesting that she is questioning the roles of women in a patriarchal society. For women in early modern England, it was not easy for them because they faced many barriers especially against the male dominated population.
